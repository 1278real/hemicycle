The purpose of this package is to draw a full-width (embed in Container to resize) representation of a semi-circle assembly...
The number of dots is up to you, by default 577 as for the French National Assembly.

## Features

You can change the number of seats (by default, 577), the arc of the circle (by default, 175Â°) and, with the specific type of inputs, you can display individual voters or sectors for group appearance...

## Getting started

TODO: List prerequisites and provide or point to information on how to
start using the package.

## Usage

Create a ```List<GroupSectors>``` containing every sectors you want to draw.
Then use ```DrawHemicycle``` to get the semi-circle assembly representation. 

```dart
class _HemicycleState extends State<Hemicycle> {
  int numberTest = 0;
  int resteTest = 0;

  List<GroupSectors> hemicycleTest = [
      GroupSectors(numberTest, customVert, description: "BEFORE"),
      GroupSectors(1, customRouge, description: "NEW"),
      GroupSectors(resteTest, customMiddleGrey1278, description: "AFTER")
    ];

  @override
  void initState() {
    numberTest = 1;
    resteTest = 577 - numberTest - 1;

    updateAndRefresh();
    super.initState();
  }
  
  void updateAndRefresh() async {
    Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 100), (() {
      setState(() {
            if (boolean) {
              datasUpdated = true;
            }
          });
    }));
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Column(
        children: <Widget>[
          if (datasUpdated)
                  DrawHemicycle(
                    resteTest + numberTest + 1,
                    nbRows: ((resteTest + numberTest + 1) / 50).ceil(),
                    groupSectors: hemicycleTest,
                    withLegend: true,
                    withTitle: true,
                    title: "TEST",
                  ),
                TextButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      setState(() {
                        numberTest += 1;
                        datasUpdated = false;
                      });
                      updateAndRefresh();
                    },
                    child:
                        Text(("PLUS UN... (" + numberTest.toString() + ")"))),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
